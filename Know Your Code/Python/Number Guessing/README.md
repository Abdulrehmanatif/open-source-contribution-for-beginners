This code works by creating an object of NumberGuessingApp which requires 3 arguments: minimum_number, maximum_number, difficulty_level, and call initiate_program() function.

The difficulty levels are "easy", "normal", and "hard".
The harder the difficulty is wider range the game will hint you when you get wrong answer.
For example, when the answer is number 10, on the easy level, the game might hint "between 8 and 11", while on harder levels, the game might hint "between 1 and 20"

When you answer correctly, it will ask if you want to restart the game. If you don't want to restart, the program will end.

This is my first time showing my own code to anyone other than myself, so I apologize if the code is incomprehensible.
